# Embedded Systems Scripting Module Code - 2021
A small repo containing the code produced for my Embedded Systems Scripting Module 2021 in WIT.

This repo contains:
- A large .sh script which is a learning program for primary school children to do their times tables.
- Several small python programs, including a Lotto program and a Hangman Program, as well as a larger Music Library program.
